TODO

read the sheet music for happy bday

figure out which notes are being played

write down the ascii representation of those notes in a file called bday.txt


helpers.c - where you'll be writing all of your code

TODO:
We are asking you to implement 3 different functions in helpers.c

implement is_rest
implement duration
implement frequency

1. is_rest
bool is_rest(string s)
function that takes a string and returns a bool

if s represents a rest, return true, else false.


2. duration
int duration(string s)
take a fraction as a string ("1/8", "1/4", "3/8" for ex)
assume numerator and denominator are each one digit
assume that the fraction works out to a whole number of eighth notes

string[0] - numerator
string[2] - denominatior

convert to number of eigth notes. CAREFUL - convert char to a number.


3. frequency
int frequency(string note)
ex. note = "A#4" ("# is an accidental")

The frequencies of one octave’s notes differ from those of adjacent octaves' notes by a factor of two. For instance, the frequency
of A3 is 220 Hz (i.e., half that of A4), while the frequency of A5 is 880 Hz (i.e., twice that of A4). More generally, the frequency, f,
of some note is 2n/12 × 440, where n is the number of semitones from that note to A4, where n is negative if that note is below
(i.e., to the left of) A4 and positive if that note is above (i.e., to the right of) A4.

TODO
- parse the string into a note and its octave
- calculate the frequency of the note in the given octave
- return the frequency (in hertz)

A4 = 440 Hz STANDARD

- for every semitone up we move, we multiply the frequency by 2^1/12
- for every semitone down we move, we divide the frequency by 2^1/12
