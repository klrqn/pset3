TODO

read the sheet music for happy bday

figure out which notes are being played

write down the ascii representation of those notes in a file called bday.txt


helpers.c - where you'll be writing all of your code

TODO:
We are asking you to implement 3 different functions in helpers.c

implement is_rest
implement duration
implement frequency

1. is_rest
bool is_rest(string s)
function that takes a string and returns a bool

if s represents a rest, return true, else false.


2. duration
int duration(string s)
take a fraction as a string ("1/8", "1/4", "3/8" for ex)
assume numerator and denominator are each one digit
assume that the fraction works out to a whole number of eighth notes

string[0] - numerator
string[2] - denominatior

convert to number of eigth notes. CAREFUL - convert char to a number.


3. frequency
int frequency(string note)
ex. note = "A#4" ("# is an accidental")

TODO
- parse the string into a note and its octave
- calculate the frequency of the note in the given octave
- return the frequency (in hertz)

A4 = 440 Hz STANDARD

- for every semitone up we move, we multiply the frequency by 2^1/12
- for every semitone down we move, we divide the frequency by 2^1/12
